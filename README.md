# 🎨 Drawing Canvas

A clean, responsive browser-based drawing app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — no libraries, no frameworks, just pure front-end code.

*This app lets users draw freehand with custom colors and brush sizes, clear the canvas, and download their artwork as an image.*
